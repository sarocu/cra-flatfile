# CRA-Flatfile
This is a basic app using create-react-app@v5 and @flatfile/sdk@2.2.0 to add an import button to the app

- this demonstrates dev mode functionality
- to use in production, you will need to securely generate a JWT and pass it to the app
- confirmed functional on node v14 + v16
- replace the EMBED_ID in `importer.js` with your own!
